# 077. Parameterized DML needs a separate preview path

The JDBC fallback described here is superseded by [128](128-jdbc-prepared-mutation-execution.md).

## Context

The staged mutation workflow in `clutch-edit.el` used to build final SQL strings for `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` by escaping values directly into the statement text.

The goal of this change was to move native backends to prepared / parameterized execution while keeping the existing confirmation and preview UX unchanged.

## Decision

- Mutation builders now return `(SQL-TEMPLATE . PARAMS)` pairs.
- Confirmation prompts and `clutch-preview-execution-sql` still render a fully interpolated SQL string for readability.
- Execution goes through `clutch-db-execute-params`.
- JDBC is allowed to keep using the generic fallback path that renders the template and calls `clutch-db-query`.

## Why

Trying to use one representation for both preview and execution causes the wrong tradeoff in both directions:

- A rendered SQL string is readable to the user, but it throws away the parameter boundary we need for protocol-level binding.
- A parameterized template is the right execution payload, but it is a worse confirmation prompt because the user no longer sees the real values that will be sent.

Separating the two lets us keep the user-facing workflow stable while changing only the execution semantics underneath.

## PostgreSQL note

The original plan was to use `pg-exec-prepared` directly for all PostgreSQL parameterized DML.

That works for ordinary non-NULL values, but `pg-el` does not cleanly support the combination we need for staged mutations:

- protocol-level NULL parameters
- unspecified / inferred parameter types

For that reason, the PostgreSQL adapter keeps the ordinary `pg-exec-prepared` path for non-NULL argument lists, but uses a small null-safe wrapper for the NULL case so that `nil` is sent as a real protocol NULL instead of being degraded back into string interpolation.
