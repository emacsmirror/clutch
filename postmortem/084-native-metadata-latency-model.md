# 084 — Native Metadata Latency Model

## Context

Native MySQL/PostgreSQL metadata used to sit directly on interactive paths:

- connect/reconnect blocked on initial schema snapshots
- CAPF and Eldoc could synchronously fetch metadata during typing
- explicit schema refresh and passive cache hydration were not clearly split

Those are different workflows and need different latency contracts.

## Final Decision

`clutch` now uses one metadata latency model:

- passive metadata hydration stays off the immediate command path
- native CAPF and Eldoc stay cache-first
- explicit `C-c C-s` schema refresh stays foreground
- native backends do not use Emacs Lisp worker threads

Native MySQL/PostgreSQL still expose async metadata entry points, but those paths now defer work with idle-time callbacks on the main thread rather than real worker threads. JDBC remains async through the external agent, and SQLite keeps its synchronous in-process path.

## Why This Split

Background schema priming exists to keep connect usable sooner. Completion and Eldoc must never block on metadata round-trips because they sit on typing and point-motion hot paths. Explicit repair commands are different: when the user presses `C-c C-s`, the useful contract is "refresh now", not "queued in the background".

Result buffers follow the same rule. Initial render uses cached column detail when available, then deferred metadata work fills the cache for later `?` and related detail display.

## Why Worker Threads Were Abandoned

The first native implementation used one Emacs worker thread per connection. That reduced foreground blocking but proved unsafe: unrelated package timers could run on the worker thread, which caused real crashes on macOS.

The durable lesson is not "hide the worker better"; it is that native metadata isolation in Emacs Lisp threads is the wrong boundary for `clutch`.

## Result

- connect/reconnect can return before passive metadata hydration finishes
- CAPF and Eldoc stay responsive and cache-first
- explicit refresh remains the trusted recovery path
- the package keeps deferred metadata behavior without owning unsafe worker threads
